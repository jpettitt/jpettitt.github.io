## John Pettitt

Hi, you've probably landed here because you typed in one of my personal domains.  The first thing you should know that none of them are for sale!  

I'm a Senior Staff Software Engineer at Google.

I've created and led successful technology companies for 30 years. I have had four successful exits as a founder: two sales (Relay Media and Specialix) and two successful IPOs (CyberSource and Beyond.com). CyberSource was subsequently purchased by VISA for $2 billion, and Beyond.com went on to achieve $100 million in revenues.

I'm a pioneer in content protection and e-commerce including the first ever app store, software.net in 1994. I am the inventor of multiple U.S. technology patents in online fraud detection, and content distribution. 

[Here is my resume](/resume.html) if you want to know more about what I do for work
